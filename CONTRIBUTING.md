# Welcome to Wultra contributing guide

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project!


## Commits Signing

In order to eliminate the risk that an unknown commit is merged to one of our GitHub repositories, we require all developers to sign all their commits.
All developers can then prove their identity via the signature and the commits will be verified.
[Learn more about signing commits](https://docs.github.com/articles/about-gpg/).


## Issues

Every change should be related to an issue.
If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue.


## Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.
Don't forget to [link PR to issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue).


## Continuous Integration

PRs are verified by Continues Integration tools. All checks should pass.


## Contributor License Agreement

To accept your changes, we need you to fill in [Contributor License Agreement](https://forms.gle/wWZzNR3Vn6nsqqgw6).
