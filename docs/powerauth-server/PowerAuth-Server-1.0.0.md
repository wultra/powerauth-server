## Database Changes

Following DB changes occurred between version 0.24.0 and 1.0.0:
- Table `pa_activation` - added column `flags`.
- Table `pa_application` - added column `roles`.
- Table `pa_application_callback` - added column `attributes`.
- Table `pa_recovery_config` - added column `postcard_priv_key_encryption`.

<!-- begin box warning -->
Warning: If you are upgrading to 1.0.0 version, please use `POSTCARD_PRIVATE_KEY_ENCRYPTION` in the last command. The column name was changed to `POSTCARD_PRIV_KEY_ENCRYPTION` in 1.0.1 bugfix version to account for the 30-character limit in the Oracle databases. If you are upgrading from 1.0.0 version and already used the old column name, make sure to apply the additional change.
<!-- end -->

Migration script for Oracle:

```sql
ALTER TABLE "PA_ACTIVATION" ADD "FLAGS" VARCHAR2(255 CHAR);
ALTER TABLE "PA_APPLICATION" ADD "ROLES" VARCHAR2(255 CHAR);
ALTER TABLE "PA_APPLICATION_CALLBACK" ADD "ATTRIBUTES" VARCHAR2(1024 CHAR);
ALTER TABLE "PA_RECOVERY_CONFIG" ADD "POSTCARD_PRIV_KEY_ENCRYPTION" NUMBER(10,0) DEFAULT 0 NOT NULL;
```

Migration script for MySQL:

```sql
ALTER TABLE `pa_activation` ADD `flags` varchar(255);
ALTER TABLE `pa_application` ADD `roles` varchar(255);
ALTER TABLE `pa_application_callback` ADD `attributes` text NOT NULL;
ALTER TABLE `pa_recovery_config` ADD `postcard_priv_key_encryption` int(11) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0;
```

Migration script for PostgreSQL:

```sql
ALTER TABLE "pa_activation" ADD "flags" VARCHAR(255);
ALTER TABLE "pa_application" ADD "roles" VARCHAR(255);
ALTER TABLE "pa_application_callback" ADD "attributes" VARCHAR(1024);
ALTER TABLE "pa_recovery_config" ADD "postcard_priv_key_encryption" INTEGER DEFAULT 0 NOT NULL;
```

## New REST Client and SOAP Client Updates

We introduced a new REST client in release 1.0.0 and recommend migrating to the REST client in case you use the SOAP client,
the provided functionality is identical.

The SOAP clients for Spring and Java EE are still available, however these clients are marked as deprecated, and they will 
be removed in a future release.

Marshaller context path setting have been updated due to the migration of client model classes and due to company name change to Wultra. 

Original context path setting:

```java
marshaller.setContextPath("io.getlime.powerauth.soap.v3");
```

New context path setting:
```java
marshaller.setContextPath("com.wultra.security.powerauth.client.v3");
```

The version 2 context path package has changed the same way, so you will need to update the version 2 path in case you still use the version 2 interface, too.

In your client projects, use the new `com.wultra.security.powerauth.client` packages for the client model classes.

For more information about the new REST client, see [the REST client documentation](./Configuring-REST-Client-for-Spring.md)

## Migration of PowerAuth Clients to REST Interface

PowerAuth clients in PowerAuth stack use the REST interface in version `1.0.0`. Previous versions of PowerAuth components used the SOAP interface. This change needs to be reflected in configuration property `powerauth.service.url` in all components which use the PowerAuth client.

Property value before migration:
`powerauth.service.url=http://[server]:[port]/powerauth-java-server/soap`

Property value after migration:
`powerauth.service.url=http://[server]:[port]/powerauth-java-server/rest`

Following components use the PowerAuth client:
- PowerAuth Admin
- PowerAuth Web Flow
- PowerAuth Push Server
- PowerAuth Enrollment Serer

Make sure to update the `powerauth.service.url` property in each of these components.
