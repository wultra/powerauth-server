# Web Services - Method Compatibility

This chapter describes REST / SOAP (deprecated) interface changes per each REST / SOAP method between PowerAuth protocol versions `2` and `3`. 
The table below lists which methods are available for each version of PowerAuth protocol and describes how to handle the interface change.

| Method                      | `v2` | `v3` | Compatibility issues | Migration notes |
| --------------------------- |:----:|:----:| -------------------- | --------------- |
| `getActivationStatus`       |      |  X   | Binary representation of encrypted status blob changed | Method moved to `v3`, use `v3` method, migrate to updated `PowerAuthServerActivation.encryptedStatusBlob` method, see [Status Blob Format](https://github.com/wultra/powerauth-crypto/blob/develop/docs/Activation-Status.md#status-blob-format) |
| `initActivation`            |      |  X   | `activationCode` replaced `activationOTP` and `activationIdShort`, `activationSignature` is calculated only from `activationCode` | Migrate to response with new `activationCode` structure, see [Activation Code](https://github.com/wultra/powerauth-crypto/blob/develop/docs/Activation-Code.md) |
| `prepareActivation`         |  X   |  X   | `v3` version uses ECIES, incompatible with `v2`| Use either `v2` (will be deprecated in future release) or migrate to ECIES in `v3` | 
| `createActivation`          |  X   |  X   | `v3` version uses ECIES, incompatible with `v2`| Use either `v2` (will be deprecated in future release) or migrate to ECIES in `v3` |
| `vaultUnlock`               |  X   |  X   | `v3` version uses ECIES, incompatible with `v2`| Use either `v2` (will be deprecated in future release) or migrate to ECIES in `v3` |
| `verifySignature`           |      |  X   | Added `forcedSignatureVersion`, PowerAuth uses signature version based on activation version, `forcedSignatureVersion` parameter is used during activation upgrade and is optional | Method moved to `v3`, use `v3` method |
| `createPersOfflineSigPl`    |      |  X   |                      | Method moved to `v3`, use `v3` method   |
| `createNonPersOfflineSigPl` |      |  X   |                      | Method moved to `v3`, use `v3` method   |
| `verifyOfflineSignature`    |      |  X   | PowerAuth server uses `v2` or `v3` version of signature based on version of activation | Method moved to `v3`, use `v3` method   |
| `generateE2EPersEncKey`     |  X   |      | Not supported in `v3`, used in legacy E2E encryption | ECIES-based encryption should be used as replacement for legacy E2E encryption |
| `generateE2ENonPersEncKey`  |  X   |      | Not supported in `v3`, used in legacy E2E encryption | ECIES-based encryption should be used as replacement for legacy E2E encryption |
| `createToken`               |  X   |  X   | ECIES private key and `sharedInfo` parameter have changed in `v3` which broke compatibility | Use either `v2` (will be deprecated in future release) or migrate to new ECIES parameters in `v3` |
| `validateToken`             |      |  X   |                      | Method moved to `v3`, use `v3` method   |
| `removeToken`               |      |  X   |                      | Method moved to `v3`, use `v3` method   |
