# Using REST / SOAP Service Client

PowerAuth assumes that the end-user client application (for example, mobile banking) is managed via a secure "master front-end application", for example via the Internet banking. Internet banking has to display a page to the user with the device activation list and allow user to create a new activation and manage existing activations.

In order to integrate your web application with REST services provided by PowerAuth Server, follow this tutorial:
