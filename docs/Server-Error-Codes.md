# PowerAuth Server Error Codes

PowerAuth Server may return following errors:

| Error Code | Error Message | Note |
|------------|---------------|------|
| ERR0000    | _Unknown error occurred._ | In case any unknown or low-level java error occurs, this exception is thrown. The original exception info is returned in the message |
| ERR0001    | No user ID was set. | Method, that requires user ID, was not provided with one. |
| ERR0002    | No application ID was set. | Method, that requires an application ID, was not provided with one. |
| ERR0003    | No master server key pair configured in database. | There is an issue with the database - an application does not have any master server key pair associated. This can happen only when manipulating with database manually or when there is a database consistency error. Use PowerAuth Admin to avoid this error. |
| ERR0004    | Master server key pair contains private key in incorrect format. | There is an issue with the database - an application has an associated master server key pair, but the format of this key is incorrect. This can happen only when manipulating with database manually or when there is a database consistency error. User PowerAuth Admin to avoid this error. |
| ERR0005    | Too many failed attempts to generate activation ID. | In order to uniquely identify an activation, a random UUID (level 4) is generated as an activation ID. In a very unlikely case of a collision, server attempts to generate a new one, at most 10 times. When the new activation ID generation fails 10 times, this error is returned. |
| ERR0006    | Too many failed attempts to generate activation code. | In order to uniquely identify an activation during the activation process, a random activation code (4x5 characters in Base32 encoding) is generated. In a very unlikely case of a collision, server attempts to generate a new one, at most 10 times. When the new activation code generation fails 10 times, this error is returned. |
| ERR0007    | This activation is already expired. | In case activation is in the state when it cannot be completed. This may be either due to time-out (activation was not committed fast enough) or in case someone tries to commit random / expired / blocked activations. |
| ERR0008    | Incorrect activation state. | Activation state is invalid. For instance, when client attempts to commit an activation in any other state than PENDING_COMMIT, or when client attempts to commit a non-existing activation. |
| ERR0009    | Activation with given activation ID was not found. | Service didn't find an activation with given ID. |
| ERR0010    | Key with invalid format was provided. | In case the cryptographic method in initActivation method was provided with a key in incorrect format. |
| ERR0011    | Invalid input parameter format. | Provided data was not in a correct format. For example, values that were expected to be Base64 encoded or dates in specific date format were invalid. |
| ERR0012    | Invalid Signature Provided. | Signature verification failed since the verification process computed a different signature than the one that was provided by a client. |
| ERR0013    | Unable to compute signature. | It was not possible to compute the signature. |
| ERR0014    | Invalid URL format. | Provided URL has invalid format. |
| ERR0015    | Invalid application. | Application or application version does not exist. |
| ERR0016    | Invalid token. | Token with given token ID does not exist. _Obsolete error code - the error is handled by response_. |
| ERR0017    | Encryption failed. | Data encryption failed. |
| ERR0018    | Decryption failed. | Data decryption failed. |
| ERR0019    | Unable to generate token. | Token was not successfully generated. |
| ERR0020    | Missing master DB encryption key. | Master DB encryption key is not configured. |
| ERR0021    | Unsupported encryption mode. | Configured encryption mode is not supported. |
| ERR0022    | Generic cryptography error. | Unspecified cryptography error occurred. |
| ERR0023    | Invalid cryptography provider. | Cryptography provider is initialized incorrectly. |
| ERR0024    | Invalid request. | The request sent to the server is invalid. |
| ERR0025    | Recovery code already exists. | Could not generate recovery code because a valid recovery code already exists. |
| ERR0026    | Too many failed attempts to generate recovery code. | In order to uniquely identify a recovery code, a random recovery code (4x5 characters in Base32 encoding) is generated. In a very unlikely case of a collision, server attempts to generate a new one, at most 10 times. When the new recovery code generation fails 10 times, this error is returned. |
| ERR0027    | Recovery code was not found. | An action was attempted on a recovery code which does not exist. |
| ERR0028    | Invalid recovery code. | Used combination of recovery code and PUK is invalid. | 
| ERR0029    | Invalid recovery configuration. | Recovery code configuration is missing or incomplete. |
| ERR0030    | Token timestamp is too old. | In case token validation fails due to token being no longer valid. |
| ERR0031    | Activation OTP doesn't match value stored in database, or the OTP value is provided for the wrong validation step. |
| ERR0032    | Activation OTP operation is performed for the wrong validation mode. |
| ERR0033    | Operation template was not found. |
| ERR0034    | Operation was not found. |
| ERR0035    | Too many failed attempts to generate operation ID. |
| ERR0036    | Operation state is invalid for the requested change. |
| ERR0037    | Operation cannot be approved. |
| ERR0038    | Operation cannot be rejected. |
| ERR0039    | Operation template already exists. |
| ERR0040    | Activation cannot be created with the specified properties. |
| ERR0041    | Operation related error occurred. |
| ERR0042    | Operation template related error occurred. |

For each of these issues, more details about the specific nature and cause can be found in the server log.
